I'm building a stock market application and need help deciding on the tech stack. The app needs to:
- Display real-time stock prices and charts
- Handle user portfolios and transactions
- Scale to potentially thousands of concurrent users

What are the key factors I should consider when choosing the tech stack? Help me think through the trade-offs.
